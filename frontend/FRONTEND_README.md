# ZLM Chatbot Frontend UI

## Railway Deployment Issue

Current Railway URL shows: `{"message":"Chatbot API Server","version":"1.0.0"}`

This means Railway is serving backend API, not frontend UI.

## Solution
Need to create separate Railway service for frontend.

## Frontend Features
- Real-time chat interface
- AI Agent management  
- Session management
- Analytics dashboard
- Mobile responsive design
